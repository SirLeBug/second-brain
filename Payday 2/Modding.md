### Advanced Movement Standalone

##### - Instructions

**SLIDING**

-   To slide, crouch from a sprint or sprint-jump. If hold-to-slide is on (check the mod options to change), also hold a movement key while sliding.
-   Use movement keys to change slide direction or stop. Slides are instantly stopped by uncrouching.
-   Slides can be extended or shortened by sloped surfaces.

**WALLHANGING/WALLKICKING**

-   To wallhang, hold jump while approaching or near a wall to hang on it. While hanging, release jump to wallkick in the direction you're facing.
-   Aiming down sights makes you slip down the wall at 25% speed for up to 6 seconds.

**KICKING**

-   To kick: sprint, wallkick, dash, or slide into an object or enemy for 175 damage and 2000 knockdown. Civilians and surrendered enemies are not targeted. Kicks done from a wallkick deal twice as much damage and have stronger knockdown.
-   Shields can be knocked over with Shock and Awe aced.
-   Hitting enemies drains stamina. Hitting inanimate objects does not.

**DASHING**

-   To dash, double-tap a directional movement key or set a keybind in mod options. This can be done while sliding.
-   Dashes do not cost stamina, but will stop stamina regeneration.

**WALLRUNNING**

-   To wallrun, jump towards a wall at an angle and tap (or mash) sprint before you reach the peak of your jump.
-   Jump while wallrunning to wallkick.
-   Wallrunning requires a long and flat surface to work at all, making it hard or nearly impossible to use without a purpose-designed wallrunning map.
