### Pokemon Infinite Fusion Magic Boots

This is a hex editing trick to obtain the Magic Boots earlier than you should, your welcome Chris. :^)

TRANSCRIPT

	Just found it for 5.1.2.3 [ 0C CB A9 03 ]
	1. Ok, starting the game there should be a potion in your PC. Follow the instructions on the original post up to step 4. 1. In Cheat Engine search for 3 as your First Scan 2. get another Potion and deposit it in the PC 3. In cheat engine search for 5 as your Next Scan 4. Withdraw one Potion, search for 3 ( this should zero you in on the memory address for the remaining Potion in your PC, if there are still too many results, just keep depositing and withdrawing one of the Potions and searching for the number in Cheat Engine where 3=1 potion, 5=2 potions.) 5. Once you have zeroed in to the Memory address for the potion, right click on the address and choose to Browse Memory Region or CTRL+B. 6. scroll up one line, right at the end you should see 0C 4B 72 02 change that to ~~0C EB 43 04~~ ([ 0C CB A9 03 ]) 7. That should turn the potion in the PC into Magic Boots. I don't know if there's any easier way to do it, but this one works for me.
